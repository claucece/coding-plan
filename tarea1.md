# Prime Factors Exercise

__Rules__

Write a method generate(int n) that given an integer N will return a list of integers such that the numbers are the
factors of N and are arranged in increasing numerical order.

For example, `generate(1)` should return an empty list and `generate(30)` should return the numbers: `2,3,5`.

# FizzBuzz Exercise

FizzBuzz is a simple number game where you count, but say "Fizz" and/or "Buzz" instead of numbers adhering to certain
rules.

__Rules__

Create a FizzBuzz() method that prints out the numbers 1 through 100. Instead of numbers divisible by three print "Fizz".
Instead of numbers divisible by five print "Buzz". Instead of numbers divisible by three and five print "FizzBuzz".


Sample Output:

    1
    2
    Fizz
    4
    Buzz
    Fizz
    7
    8
    Fizz
    Buzz
    11
    Fizz
    13
